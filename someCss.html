	<h1>Here is my original work</h1>
	<p class= "a">In this original work part of the second builder, I decided to first set a background color. This was my "Unique CSS command that we didn't discuss in class". I then searched online how to change fonts for different texts and decided to make my first paragraph Arial font at the size of 15px.</p>
	<p class= "b">For my next paragraph, I decided to make the text Georgia font, also at 15px. The instructions didn't specify what the paragraphs were supposed to be about so I'll just give some basic descriptions about me. My name is Jacob Wetherbee, and i'm 19 years old. I grew up in San Francisco, California. I'm currently a freshman at the University of Washington trying to major in Business</p>
